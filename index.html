                    Credia is an exclusive social media built by nerds for you. We personally think that credia is the next generation social media utility required by anyone in our country to make money matters easy for them. All of us in College or Work feel that money goes away too quickly but still you have responsibilities like taking her to shopping, watch the latest Marvel movie in IMAX, Go on a solo trip to Manali or even gift your close ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Credia is targeted at GenZ for their instant needs. Small amounts are every now and then exchanged by friends. Now, you have the ultimate lending and borrowing source that is credible and helps you in your rainy days along with exclusive offers and incentives curated just for you.
